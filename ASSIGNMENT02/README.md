# Fitness Meal Tracker

I built this app for COMP2068 to practice Express, MongoDB, and authentication.

The idea is simple: I always forget what I ate and how many calories it was.  
This app lets me log meals with calories and macros, and it keeps everything tied to my account.

## Features

- Register / login with email + password
- Social login with **GitHub** and **Google**
- Add, edit, and delete meals (CRUD)
- Public read-only list of meals
- Protected dashboard so each user only sees their own meals

## Tech

- Node.js + Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- Passport (local, GitHub, Google strategies)
- Handlebars (HBS) views
- Deployed on Render
